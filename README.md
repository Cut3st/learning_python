![](https://geps.dev/progress/48)

‚úÖ Day 1 - (1:06:12/12:00:00) *11th June 2025*
 - Completed simple calculator project

Reflection:  `4.5 hours of studying mostly trying to figure out how tf to commit code to github then realised i messed up the venv and project files structure and having to redo everything`

‚úÖ Day 2 - (1:08:37/12:00:00) *12th June 2025*
 - Pending Temp, Weight, Height Converter and BMI Calculator (Health Survey) project

Reflection:  `1 hour to "study" since its late, little progress with the video due to to me additional requirements to the project BroCodez requested for, literally only converting weight and temperature, i just had add more to it currently stuck at BMI wrong calculation`

‚úÖ Day 3 - (2:06:27/12:00:00) *17th June 2025*
 - Completed Health Survey project, Pending Compound Interest Calculator Project

Reflection:  `Quick 2 hours study, Took me 40 minutes to realised that the BMI calculations were wrong becaused I put elif instead of if for a totally different variable pull, learned string methods, indexing and format specifiers also while loop, learnt these before so it was quick to go through the lesson`

‚úÖ Day 4 - (2:38:04/12:00:00) *18th June 2025*
 - Completed Compound Interest Calculator and Countdown Timer Project

Reflection:  `Quick 2 hours study, Application of while loop, for loop and time assets. countdown timer was made with help ofc but slightly different as I tried to work it out by myself, realised how math is super important`

‚úÖ Day 5 - (3:03:36/12:00:00) *24th June 2025*
 - Completed Shopping Cart Program and Quiz Game Project

Reflection:  `3 hours study, Took a 6-day coding break due to army fatigue (partly an excuse). I try not to follow tutorials exactly‚Äîalways tweak and build on them. I use Copilot for help when stuck, though I could rely on it less. With the help of Copilot, I've got implement my ideas and learned a lot from it, but I need to code more consistently to really grasp variables, conditions, and methods.`

‚úÖ Day 6 - (3:11:36/12:00:00) *26th June 2025*
 - Pending Concession Stand Program

Reflection:  `Quick 1 hour study, learned dictionary with key and value and how to apply it, just a quick session LOL but anyways procastination is killing me, writing this reflection on 29th June, with barely any progress from day 5`

‚úÖ Day 7 - (4:03:01:/12:00:00) *4th July 2025*
 - Completed Concession Stand Program, Dice Roller, Rock Paper Scissors and Number Guessing game

Reflection:  `Procasinated again as i was busy last week, but got in 4‚Äì5 hours of coding today. Went through random number lesson and provided projects, made them replayable, and worked through most of the logic independently before checking the tutorial.`

‚úÖ Day 8 - (4:30:38:/12:00:00) *9th July 2025*
 - None

Reflection:  `Quick 1 hour study, Procasinated 5 days again...got no more excuse gotta lock in now school starting soon, anyways today i just went through, default, keyword and arbi arguments thats all.`

‚úÖ Day 9 - (5:02:38:/12:00:00) *11th July 2025*
 - None

Reflection:  `Quick 1 hour study, was busy catching up on math but wtv went through, Match-case statement (Switch), List comprehension, Membership operators and Iterables`

‚úÖ Day 10 - (5:38:38:/12:00:00) *13th July 2025*
 - Pending Banking, Slot Machine, Encryption and Hangman Program

Reflection:  `Quick 30 mins study learn about modules, variable scope & scope resolution and if __name__ == __main__: mostly theory`
