![](https://geps.dev/progress/33)

‚úÖ Day 1 - (1:06:12/12:00:00) *11th June 2025*
 - Completed simple calculator project

Reflection:  `4.5 hours of studying mostly trying to figure out how tf to commit code to github then realised i messed up the venv and project files structure and having to redo everything`

‚úÖ Day 2 - (1:08:37/12:00:00) *12th June 2025*
 - Pending Temp, Weight, Height Converter and BMI Calculator (Health Survey) project

Reflection:  `1 hour to "study" since its late, little progress with the video due to to me additional requirements to the project BroCodez requested for, literally only converting weight and temperature, i just had add more to it currently stuck at BMI wrong calculation`

‚úÖ Day 3 - (2:06:27/12:00:00) *17th June 2025*
 - Completed Health Survey project, Pending Compound Interest Calculator Project

Reflection:  `Quick 2 hours study, Took me 40 minutes to realised that the BMI calculations were wrong becaused I put elif instead of if for a totally different variable pull, learned string methods, indexing and format specifiers also while loop, learnt these before so it was quick to go through the lesson`

‚úÖ Day 4 - (2:38:04/12:00:00) *18th June 2025*
 - Completed Compound Interest Calculator and Countdown Timer Project

Reflection:  `Quick 2 hours study, Application of while loop, for loop and time assets. countdown timer was made with help ofc but slightly different as I tried to work it out by myself, realised how math is super important`

‚úÖ Day 5 - (3:03:36/12:00:00) *24th June 2025*
 - Completed Shopping Cart Program and Quiz Game Project

Reflection:  `3 hours study, Took a 6-day coding break due to army fatigue (partly an excuse). I try not to follow tutorials exactly‚Äîalways tweak and build on them. I use Copilot for help when stuck, though I could rely on it less. With the help of Copilot, I've got implement my ideas and learned a lot from it, but I need to code more consistently to really grasp variables, conditions, and methods.`

‚úÖ Day 6 - (3:11:36/12:00:00) *26th June 2025*
 - Pending Concession Stand Program

Reflection:  `Quick 1 hour study, learned dictionary with key and value and how to apply it, just a quick session LOL but anyways procastination is killing me, writing this reflection on 29th June, with barely any progress from day 5`

‚úÖ Day 7 - (4:03:01:/12:00:00) *4th July 2025*
 - Completed Concession Stand Program, Dice Roller, Rock Paper Scissors and Number Guessing game

Reflection:  `4-5Hours of Study and researching how to make the project codes better than the tutorial without over complicating it, all the projects from today were to practice random numbers lesson, i made the games replayable as compared to the tutorial and mostly did the projects on my own before refering to the tutorial`
