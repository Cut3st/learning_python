Progress🎚️: 

![](https://geps.dev/progress/8)

✅ Day 1 - (1:06:12/12:00:00) *11th June 2025*
 - Completed simple calculator project

Reflection:  `4.5 hours of studying mostly trying to figure out how tf to commit code to github then realised i messed up the venv and project files structure and having to redo everything`
✅ Day 2 - (1:08:37/12:00:00) *11th June 2025*
 - Pending Temp, Weight, Height Converter and BMI Calculator

Reflection:  `Had only an hour to "study" since its late, little progress with the video due to to me additional requirements to the project BroCodez requested for, literally only converting weight and temperature, i just had add more to it currently stuck at BMI wrong calculation`
